        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>10 cups fresh spinach</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded provolone cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) container whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>5 cups marinara sauce</li>
        <li>12 oven-ready lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Toss together butternut squash, 2 teaspoons of the oil,
            1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Arrange in a single layer on a rimmed baking
            sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until softened and lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and 1/4
            teaspoon of the salt, and cook, stirring often, until softened and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add spinach,
            and cook, stirring often, until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine shredded provolone and mozzarella in a bowl. Stir together ricotta, parsley, eggs, 1 1/2 cups of the
            shredded cheese mixture, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Lightly coat a 13x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spread 1 cup of the marinara on the bottom. Arrange
            4 noodles side by side over sauce; spread half of ricotta mixture over noodles. Spread roasted squash evenly
            over ricotta mixture; top with 1 1/2 cups marinara. Top with 4 more noodles and remaining ricotta mixture.
            Spread spinach mixture evenly over ricotta mixture; top with 1 1/2 cups marinara. Top with remaining 4
            noodles and 1 cup marinara. Sprinkle with Parmesan and remaining shredded cheese mixture. Cover with
            aluminum foil. </li>
        <li>Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 35 minutes. Uncover; bake until golden and bubbly, about 20
            minutes more. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting into 10 slices.</li>
    </ol>
